## Description
   This project was created to gain experience using Nodejs and various npm packages. It uses Inquirer to ask for the users Github username and their favorite color. It then uses their username with the Axios package to get their github information and repos. Using the fs package, it then creates a new html page using the information provided, then uses the html-pdf package to convert it to a pdf file.

## Usage
   To use this application, use the command "node index.js". The program will then ask you to enter a github username and to select a color from the provided list. Once the information has been given, the pdf file will be available in the "pdf" folder that is in the same directory.
